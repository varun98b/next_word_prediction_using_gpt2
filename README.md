# next_word_prediction_using_gpt2

For this part, we'll need to set up a Python environment and use the Hugging Face Transformers library to generate text with a pre-trained model. Steps followed are:
1.	Install Required Libraries: The Transformers library is required to interface with pre-trained models for text generation.
2.	Import Necessary Modules: The pipeline module from Transformers will be used for text generation.
3.	Choose a Pretrained Model: We'll select a model suitable for the task from Hugging Face's model hub(gpt2).
4.	Create a Text Generation Pipeline: Initialize a pipeline with the chosen model.
5.	Generate Text: Provide prompts to the pipeline and generate text.
6.	Display and Analyze Generated Text: We'll examine the generated text for creativity and relevance.
